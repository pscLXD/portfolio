<h2>Sample Projects Using Storyline</h2>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/UsingAssistiveTechnology/story.html">Using Assistive Technology</a></h3>
<p>We talk alot about assistive technology, but if you're not using the tools, or if you don't truly understand the challenges others face, you may be creating issues in your design choices. This activity was meant build understanding of some of those issues and how those tools work.</p>  
<br>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/BringOnTheDancingRobotsPortfolio/story.html">Inputs and Outputs</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of this fun little activity was to show how inputs and outputs work. You choose music and dance moves as your inputs, and the robot's dance moves are your ourput. You have 1 minute to mix tunes and show off your moves.</p>
<br>
<h2>Team Fun and Games using Storyline</h2>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/GuessThisThing/story.html">Guess This Thing</a></h3>
<p>My first team-building exercise. Players have to guess the object based on a zoomed in photo (reveal the object by hovering the mouse over the photo). Round two has an appearence by an 80s game show bad guy - all in good fun - but you can see the potential with Storyline.</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/EscapeRoomTeamActivity/story.html">Escape Room Team Activity</a></h3>
<p>This was my hand at a fun team-building activity, but also a chance to demonstrate to my team the different ways triggers and objects can be manipulated, and how variables can be used to allow the user freedom of choice. I'm a child of the 80s, so it's a point and click adventure!<p>
