							<p>Hey folks! I'm a former high school teacher with a passion for technology who has spent almost a decade designing learning experiences for companies like ADP and AWS. My favorite thing about being a designer and builder is making highly engaging activities in Storyline while still trying to stay rigorous and relevant. I hope you enjoy these examples and learning more about my philosophy of instructional design. If you have any feedback or suggestions, I'm always open to talking about engaging learning experiences!</p>

           	              <h3> The Royal Chonicles: An AI Research Helper</h3>
										<p>For my first sample app, I wanted something that could show regular individuals like teachers the potential of AI. This app allows them to assign a world ruler from any point in history to their students, and have the students use the app to generate research information on the topic. They could then take that information and create a report, presentation, or more. The chat function would allow them to ask further questions about their subject, especially if something that came up in their research really piqued their interest.</p>

										<p>I used this app to serve as an example of how users could use Generative AI to create their own specialty apps. What better example than parks for dogs? The hope is that users could see the opportunites out there for making their own specialized apps. If I could make one on parks for dogs in different states, they could create their own prompts and apps to make one for locations like child-friendly restaurants, or museums with senior discounts for their grandparents, or whatever else they could think of. The only limit was their imagination.</p>

Also, what's nice about this is that it's 4 slides worth of content on one slide. Users also have the option to turn on captions if they want to see the accompanying text.</p>

I decided to create a Storyline simulation showing off light gamification elements. Since I was demoing it, I didn't actually program what would happen if you got the answer wrong. Oh well, they liked it anyway, and I got hired.</p>

I wanted to show how you could run services and software in a simulated environment, saving storage space and compute power. Although it wasn't used (the stakeholders wanted to stick with traditional means), I think it goes a long way to show how users can be trained (and even led) though enviroments in a safe and non-destructive manner.</p>

										<p>My task was to create activities on sustainability and data centers. As a former school IT professional, many times I saw people take all the waste from setting up new equipment and throw in right in the recycle bins, without thought. So that inspired the task in this activity, where you drag everything to the bin and see whether or not it belongs there. A nice followup might have you decide what bin to throw the item into (I'd provide the user with multiple bin types) and see if it's right.</p>

												<h3>High-interest, high-impact learning</h3>
												<span>Above all, the coursework has to hold the learner's interest and engage them meaningfully. What better way to do that than by using the same techniques that engage them in their everyday lives? Modern training should seem fresh and
cutting-edge to learners, not overwhelming or overly-complicated. Preparing to train the Workforce of 2030 should start now.</span> </li>
