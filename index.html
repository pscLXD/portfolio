<h2>About me</h2>
Hey folks! I'm a former high school teacher with a passion for technology who has spent almost a decade designing learning experiences for companies like ADP and AWS. My favorite thing about being a designer and builder is making highly engaging activities in Storyline while still trying to stay rigorous and relevant. I hope you enjoy these examples. If you have any feedback or suggestions, I'm always open to talking about Storyline!

<h2 class="HeaderFont">Individual UX examples in Storyline</h2>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/Robotics/story.html" target="_new"><strong>Robotics</strong></a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/Robotics.png" alt="Robotics" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>This unit was a primer on Robotics. I like to use buttons to reveal information, rather than having walls of text. Also, what's nice about this is that it's 4 slides worth of content on one slide. Users also have the option to turn on captions if they want to see the accompanying text.</p>  
<br>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/AIML/story.html" target="_new"><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</strong></a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/AIML.png" alt="Robotics" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>This unit was a introduction to AI and Machine Learning. My goal was with it was to make these abstract concepts both tangable and real. I wanted to leverage images, text, and video to make these two concepts jump off the page and help people better comprehend how these worked.</p>  
<br>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/ACloserLookAtAugmentedReality/story.html" target="_blank"><strong>A Closer Look at Augmented Reality</strong></a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/ACLAAR.png" alt="A Closer Look at Augmented Reality" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>This lesson was over Augmented Reality. Same concept as above - use buttons to reveal text, give users some semblence of choice. And above all, they are interacting with the content, instead of just passively viewing it.</p>  
<br>    
<h2>Sample Projects Using Storyline</h2>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/MediaConvertASimulation/story.html" target="_new"><strong>MediaConvert A Simulation</strong></a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/MCAS.png" alt="MediaConvert A Simulation" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>This was my audition project for AWS. I had to take one of their services and create a presentation on it. I decided to create a Storyline simulation showing off light gamification elements. Since I was demoing it, I didn't actually program what would happen if you got the answer wrong. Oh well, they liked it anyway, and I got hired.</p>  
<br>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/UsingAssistiveTechnology/story.html" target="_new"><strong>Using Assistive Technology</strong></a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/UAT.png" alt="Using Assistive Technology" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>We talk alot about assistive technology, but if you're not using the tools, or if you don't truly understand the challenges others face, you may be creating issues in your design choices. This activity was meant build understanding of some of those issues and how those tools work.
<br>

<h2>Team Fun and Games using Storyline</h2>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/GuessThisThing/story.html" target="_new"><strong>Guess This Thing</strong></a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/GTT.png" alt="Guess This Thing" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>My first team-building exercise. Players have to guess the object based on a zoomed in photo (reveal the object by hovering the mouse over the photo). Round two has an appearence by an 80s game show bad guy - all in good fun - but you can see the potential with Storyline.</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/EscapeRoomTeamActivity/story.html" target="_new"><strong>Escape Room Team Activity</strong></a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/ERTA.png" alt="Escape Room Team Activity" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>This was my hand at a fun team-building activity, but also a chance to demonstrate to my team the different ways triggers and objects can be manipulated, and how variables can be used to allow the user freedom of choice. I'm a child of the 80s, so it's a point and click adventure!<p>
