<a href="/portfolio/BringOnTheDancingRobotsPortfolio/story.html">Inputs and Outputs</a>
<p>The purpose of this fun little activity was to show how inputs and outputs work. You choose music and dance moves as your inputs, and the robot's dance moves are your ourput. You have 1 minute to mix tunes and show off your moves.</p>

<a href="/portfolio/EscapeRoomTeamActivity/story.html">Escape Room Team Activity</a>
<p>This was my hand at a fun team-building activity, but also a chance to demonstrate to my team the different ways triggers and objects can be manipulated, and how variables can be used to allow the user freedom of choice. I'm a child of the 80s, so it's a point and click adventure!<p>
