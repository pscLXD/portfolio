<h2>Sample Projects Using Storyline</h2>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/MediaConvertASimulation/story.html">MediaConvert A Simulation</a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/MCAS.png" alt="MediaConvert A Simulation" width="200" height="Auto">
<p>This was my audition project for AWS. I had to take one of their services and create a presentation on it. I decided to create a Storyline simulation showing off light gamification elements. Since I was demoing it, I didn't actually program what would happen if you got the answer wrong. Oh well, they liked it anyway, and I got hired.</p>

<h3><a href="/portfolio/UsingAssistiveTechnology/story.html">Using Assistive Technology</a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/UAT.png" alt="Using Assistive Technology" width="200" height="Auto">
<p>We talk alot about assistive technology, but if you're not using the tools, or if you don't truly understand the challenges others face, you may be creating issues in your design choices. This activity was meant build understanding of some of those issues and how those tools work.</p>  
<br>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/BringOnTheDancingRobotsPortfolio/story.html">Inputs and Outputs</a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/Robots.png" alt="Bring On The Dancing Robots" width="200" height="Auto">
<p>The purpose of this fun little activity was to show how inputs and outputs work. You choose music and dance moves as your inputs, and the robot's dance moves are your ourput. You have 1 minute to mix tunes and show off your moves.</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/IsThisRecyclable/story.html">Can This Be Recycled?</a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/IRT.png" alt="Can This Be Recycled" width="200" height="Auto">
<p>My task was to create activities on sustainability and data centers. As a former school IT professional, many times I saw people take all the waste from setting up new equipment and throw in right in the recycle bins, without thought. So that inspired the task in this activity, where you drag everything to the bin and see whether or not it belongs there. A nice followup might
    have you decide what bin to throw the item into (I'd provide the user with multiple bin types) and see if it's right.</p>

<h2>Game-Based Learning Simulations Using Storyline</h2>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/NatureAndCitiesSimulation/story.html">Trouble In Paradise: A Resource Management Sim</a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/NCS.png" alt="Trouble In Paradise" width="200" height="Auto">
<p>My first chance to use Storyline in a learning game-type situation. As a learner, you are presented with different disaster scenarios and need to figure out the most sustainable way to address the issues. Make the wrong decision, and your popularity will suffer. Make the right choice, and your popularity will go sky-high!</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/ServerRoomSim/story.html">Sustainable Data Center: A Simulation</a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/SRS.png" alt="Server Room Sim" width="200" height="Auto">
<p>My second big learning game-type situation. Design and build a sustainable data center. Learn from your choices, and try to figure out a balance while building. Once the center is built, it's time to make sure you can maintain and secure your data!</p>

<h2>Team Fun and Games using Storyline</h2>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/GuessThisThing/story.html">Guess This Thing</a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/GTT.png" alt="Guess This Thing" width="200" height="Auto">
<p>My first team-building exercise. Players have to guess the object based on a zoomed in photo (reveal the object by hovering the mouse over the photo). Round two has an appearence by an 80s game show bad guy - all in good fun - but you can see the potential with Storyline.</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/EscapeRoomTeamActivity/story.html">Escape Room Team Activity</a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/ERTA.png" alt="Escape Room Team Activity" width="200" height="Auto">
<p>This was my hand at a fun team-building activity, but also a chance to demonstrate to my team the different ways triggers and objects can be manipulated, and how variables can be used to allow the user freedom of choice. I'm a child of the 80s, so it's a point and click adventure!<p>
