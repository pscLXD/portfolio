<h2>About me</h2>
Hey folks! I'm a former high school teacher with a passion for technology who has spent almost a decade designing learning experiences for companies like ADP and AWS. My favorite thing about being a designer and builder is making highly engaging activities in Storyline while still trying to stay rigorous and relevant. I hope you enjoy these examples. If you have any feedback or suggestions, I'm always open to talking about Storyline!

<h2>Generative AI App Examples</h2>
<h3><a href="https://partyrock.aws/u/psc/VKur7oq1z/The-Royal-Chronicles" target="_new"><strong>The Royal Chronicles: A Homework Helper</strong></a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/TRC.png" alt="The Royal Chronicles" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>For my first sample app, I wanted something that could show regular individuals like teachers the potential of AI. This app allows them to assign a world ruler from any point in history to their students, and have the students use the app to generate research information on the topic. They could then take that information and create a report, presentation, or more. The chat function would allow them to ask further questions about their subject, especially if something that came up in their research really piqued their interest.</p>

<h3><a href="https://partyrock.aws/u/psc/0uM308H2o/Dog-Park-Finder%3A-Parks-by-State" target="_new"><strong>Dog Park Finder: Parks by State</strong></a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/DPF.png" alt="Dog Park Finder" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>I used this app to serve as an example of how users could use Generative AI to create their own specialty apps. What better example than parks for dogs? The hope is that users could see the opportunites out there for making their own specialized apps. If I could make one on parks for dogs in different states, they could create their own prompts and apps to make one for locations like child-friendly restaurants, or museums with senior discounts for their grandparents, or whatever else they could think of. The only limit was their imagination.</p>

<img src="/portfolio/images/LOCAI.png" alt="Learning Objective Creator AI" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>This sample app shows how AI can be used as a tool to assist with conventional training and development. The objectives created here can be used as a springboard to help with course creation. The human element is what makes it interesting and engaging - using AI can help you get started!

<h2 class="HeaderFont">Individual UX examples in Storyline</h2>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/AIML/story.html" target="_new"><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</strong></a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/AIML.png" alt="Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>This unit was a introduction to AI and Machine Learning. My goal was with it was to make these abstract concepts both tangable and real. I wanted to leverage images, text, and video to make these two concepts jump off the page and help people better comprehend how these worked.</p>  
<br>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/BringOnTheDancingRobotsPortfolio/story.html" target="_new"><strong>Inputs and Outputs</strong></a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/Robots.png" alt="Bring On The Dancing Robots" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>The purpose of this fun little activity was to show how inputs and outputs work, as a follow up to the previous example. You choose music and dance moves as your inputs, and the robot's dance moves are your ourput. You have 1 minute to mix tunes and show off your moves.</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/Robotics/story.html" target="_new"><strong>Robotics</strong></a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/Robotics.png" alt="Robotics" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>This unit was a primer on Robotics. I like to use buttons to reveal information, rather than having walls of text. Also, what's nice about this is that it's 4 slides worth of content on one slide. Users also have the option to turn on captions if they want to see the accompanying text.</p>  
<br>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/ACloserLookAtAugmentedReality/story.html" target="_blank"><strong>A Closer Look at Augmented Reality</strong></a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/ACLAAR.png" alt="A Closer Look at Augmented Reality" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>This lesson was over Augmented Reality. Same concept as above - use buttons to reveal text, give users some semblence of choice. And above all, they are interacting with the content, instead of just passively viewing it.</p>  
<br>    
<h2>Sample Projects Using Storyline</h2>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/MediaConvertASimulation/story.html" target="_new"><strong>MediaConvert A Simulation</strong></a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/MCAS.png" alt="MediaConvert A Simulation" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>This was my audition project for AWS. I had to take one of their services and create a presentation on it. I decided to create a Storyline simulation showing off light gamification elements. Since I was demoing it, I didn't actually program what would happen if you got the answer wrong. Oh well, they liked it anyway, and I got hired.</p>  
<br>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/SimKBs/story.html" target="_new"><strong>Knowledge Bases: A Simulation</strong></a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/SimKBs.png" alt="Knowledge Bases" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>This was a prototype simulation I built as a proposal/alternative to hosting files and having users run serivces in their own accounts. I wanted to show how you could run services and software in a simulated environment, saving storage space and compute power. Although it wasn't used (the stakeholders wanted to stick with traditional means), I think it goes a long way to show how users can be trained (and even led) though enviroments in a safe and non-destructive manner.</p>

<h3><a href="/portfolio/UsingAssistiveTechnology/story.html" target="_new"><strong>Using Assistive Technology</strong></a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/UAT.png" alt="Using Assistive Technology" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>We talk alot about assistive technology, but if you're not using the tools, or if you don't truly understand the challenges others face, you may be creating issues in your design choices. This activity was meant build understanding of some of those issues and how those tools work.
</p>

<h3><a href="/portfolio/ServerRoomSim/story.html" target="_new"><strong>Sustainable Data Center: A Simulation</strong></a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/SRS.png" alt="Server Room Sim" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>My second big learning game-type situation. Design and build a sustainable data center. Learn from your choices, and try to figure out a balance while building. Once the center is built, it's time to make sure you can maintain and secure your data!</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/IsThisRecyclable/story.html" target="_new"><strong>Can This Be Recycled?</strong></a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/ITR.png" alt="Can This Be Recycled" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>My task was to create activities on sustainability and data centers. As a former school IT professional, many times I saw people take all the waste from setting up new equipment and throw in right in the recycle bins, without thought. So that inspired the task in this activity, where you drag everything to the bin and see whether or not it belongs there. A nice followup might
    have you decide what bin to throw the item into (I'd provide the user with multiple bin types) and see if it's right.</p>

<h2>Team Fun and Games using Storyline</h2>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/GuessThisThing/story.html" target="_new"><strong>Guess This Thing</strong></a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/GTT.png" alt="Guess This Thing" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>My first team-building exercise. Players have to guess the object based on a zoomed in photo (reveal the object by hovering the mouse over the photo). Round two has an appearence by an 80s game show bad guy - all in good fun - but you can see the potential with Storyline.</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="/portfolio/EscapeRoomTeamActivity/story.html" target="_new"><strong>Escape Room Team Activity</strong></a></h3>
<img src="/portfolio/images/ERTA.png" alt="Escape Room Team Activity" width="300" height="Auto">
<p>This was my hand at a fun team-building activity, but also a chance to demonstrate to my team the different ways triggers and objects can be manipulated, and how variables can be used to allow the user freedom of choice. I'm a child of the 80s, so it's a point and click adventure!<p>
